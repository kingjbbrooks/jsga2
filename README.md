# jsga2

This is a rewrite of [jsga](https://github.com/saebyn/jsga), a genetic algorithm demo I wrote about five years ago.

I have a version of this running at http://jsga2.saebyn.info/

I was looking for an excuse to try writing a
very basic React app, just to try that out without
any extras (Clojurescript, Om, etc).
